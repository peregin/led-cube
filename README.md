# LED Cube controlled by Arduino

The project is about building a LED cube with size 4x4x4, which is then controlled by an Arduino microcontroller.
I've spent so much time with wiring and soldering, I though will never end.
Lesson learned, use prototyping board only when you have a few (meaning max 5) components to wire together.

The code for triggering the LEDs in the cube is written in Sketch. Was really fun to debug hardware and software as well :)
